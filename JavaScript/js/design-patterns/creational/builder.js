/**
 * Builder Pattern
 * As a programmer creating objects is one of the most common things that you will do.
 * It is so common that many of us never think twice about how we do it, but this can lead to incredibly messy code.
 * This is where the builder pattern comes in. The builder pattern is one of the best creational
 * design patterns for creating complex objects without complicating your constructors or code.
 * The best part about the builder pattern is that the new changes to JavaScript allow us to create extremely
 * concise builders compared to the traditional way of creating builders.
