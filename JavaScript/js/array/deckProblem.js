 * 1 deck of cards. Itâ€™s dealt equally to both players (1/2). On each turn they flip the top-most card and compare. 
 * The player with the largest card takes both cards into a separate scoring pile. At the end of the game - the player with the larger scoring pile wins. 
 * Write a simulator and print who wins. (cards are 1 to 52)
